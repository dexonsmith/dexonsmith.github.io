All are welcome! Ladders and tournaments use New Zealand rules. Ladders have handicaps enabled. Join any or all!

The New Zealand rules are simple to reason about and encourage experimentation.

- Area scoring (stones plus surrounded territory; beginners and experts alike can count with confidence)
- Stone removal by mutual agreement (play on if you're not sure)
- 7 komi for even games; 0 komi for handicap games (draws are OK!)
- Free placement of handicap stones
- Self-capture is legal
- Situational Superko (cannot make a play that repeats the board position from one of your previous moves)
