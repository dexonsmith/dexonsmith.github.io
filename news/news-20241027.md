# 2024-10-27 Ladder updates and tournament openings

[yebellz](https://online-go.com/player/76618/yebellz) has taken the lead in the [9x9](https://online-go.com/ladder/41992) and [19x19](https://online-go.com/ladder/41994) ladders. [dexonsmith](https://online-go.com/player/178104/dexonsmith) still has the [13x13](https://online-go.com/ladder/41993) crown. Reminder that the ladders have handicaps turned on to allow a good match with anyone. Challenge the player immediately in front, aim straight for the top spot, or both!

All correspondence tournaments have openings. A few just need 1-2 more players to start.
