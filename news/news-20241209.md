[yebellz](https://online-go.com/player/76618/yebellz) has dethroned
[fuseki3](https://online-go.com/player/1185576/fuseki3) in the [9x9
ladder](https://online-go.com/ladder/41992) and is the new leader.  Since
handicaps are enabled, if you challenge, you have a chance of winning,
regardless of your rank.

[dexonsmith](https://online-go.com/player/178104/dexonsmith) still leads the
[13x13 ladder](https://online-go.com/ladder/41993) and
[yebellz](https://online-go.com/player/76618/yebellz) the [19x19
ladder](https://online-go.com/ladder/41994).  Challenges welcome there too.

Six tournaments have kicked off in the last month; all have been regenerated
and have openings.  Many just need 1-2 more players to start.  Visit [the group
page](https://online-go.com/group/14024) for up-to-date registration tables in
the bulletin.
