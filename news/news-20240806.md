# 2024-08-06 Tournament openings

As hoped, I've been regenerating tournaments consistently, usually within a day or two of them filling up. Have a look at the list of "Open tournaments" on [the group page](https://online-go.com/group/14024) to sign up (still don't have time to update the tournament tables, but I'm hoping in September...).

Message me privately if youâ€™re interested in helping out! I can add you as an admin after we discuss how to share responsibilities.
